                    <p>I created a React App using the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather forecast data. This was 
                        my very first project using React! I designed the interface of the app and implemented the 
                        search and submit functions so users would be able to type in any city and retrieve a live weather 
                        forecast of that city. I referred to the API data for the temperature, weather status, country, 
                        and weather icon. When provided with an invalid city name, the app does not return anything.

                    <p>I am currently working on an NBA fantasy application that can be used to assist NBA fans in creating
                        their ideal fantasy teams. Using React and public APIs for individual NBA player statistics, the implementation
                        of being able to view statistics for each active player is complete, and I am currently implementing a feature
                        that will allow users to assemble a hypothetical fantasy and see total team statistics. What I love about this project
                        is that as an avid NBA fantasy player, it is something that can prove to be incredibly useful for me and my fellow
                        fantasy players. There are so many different features and additions that I plan to continue to make, such as being able to
                        connect a Google account to save progress, compare different players, and creating possible season projections!

                <div class="acc-content">
                    <p>I was extremely lucky to be able to participate in Hack the North 2021, one of the largest Hackathons in North America. With a team 
                        with two other Computer Science students, we created a game in C++ and using Ubisoft's Hacker NEST framework that demonstrated to players
                        the importance of staying healthy and having a strong immune system to be able to fight against certain viruses. In the context of the 
                        pandemic, we felt the core values of the game really reflected what we wanted to emphasize with the community - building immunity by 
                        getting vaccinated can help a lot in staying helthy during this time. The DevPost can be found
